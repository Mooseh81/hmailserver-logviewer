hmailserver-logviewer
=====================

A HTML5 based realtime hMailServer log viewer. 

Save the index.html on your computer and launch it with your HTML5 File API supporting browser. 

Your log file will be parsed each half seconds at its default.
For now its only "feature" is thread grouping, so you will see your SMTP logs neatly.

Feel free to enhance or use it for your forking pleasure.
